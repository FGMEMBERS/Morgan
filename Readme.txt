ADFX-02 Morgan is a Fictional jet 


i have changed some of FDM properties so that everyone can fly it easily.



if i keep FDM as per Morgan's 3-d model it cannot fly & jet is highly unstable (just after 
take-off jet goes into uncontroled spin & starts climbing)
.

I hope u will like flying this fictional jet   :-)
